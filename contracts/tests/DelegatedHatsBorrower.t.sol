// need to add more coniditionals here to support 0/MAX_UINT.
// want infinite token and infinte epochs to always pass
// want infinite token with finite epochs to only pass if in time range
// want finite token with infinite epochs to only pass if limit is not exceeded
// want finite token with finite epochs to only pass if both conditions are met
